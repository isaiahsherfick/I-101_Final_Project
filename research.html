			Since its rough beginnings in the mid-nineties, online advertising has seen an explosion of popularity. In a 2015 study conducted by Helen Robinson, Anna Wysocka, and Chris Hand, it was found that creative characteristics of banner ads correlated in making them more effective. These characteristics include size, and a lack of intrusive text that the user may find annyoing. On the flip side, features such as animation and flagrant branding were found to be ineffective in generating clicks. Unexpectedly, it was found that long messages were associated with higher click-through rates (Robinson).

			Targeted advertising is the modern root to customer acquisition in the United States. Facebook offers businesses some of the biggest networks when it comes to advertising and allows each advertiser to gauge and apply which demographic receives this ad on their feed. This sort of targeted advertising is perfect for attracting new users to our service because it allows us to reach the specific demographics that show interest in our service (Kim).
