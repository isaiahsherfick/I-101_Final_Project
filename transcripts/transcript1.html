Me: \u201cBeing a DJ, do you feel like you\u2019re adequately connected to the community?\u201d


Mack Raskoski: \u201cNot really I mainly just play at friend\u2019s parties or at my fraternity house\u201d


Me: Would you be open to playing for people outside your friend group?\u201d


Mack Raskoski: for sure, I like spinning whenever I can. I love DJ ing in front of a new crowd\u201d


Me: \u201cDo you think an app connecting you to people around you looking for DJ\u2019s would be helpful to you?\u201d


Mack Raskoski: \u201cYeah that would be cool, social media and apps are how I meet new people and make new connections a lot of the time\u201d


Me: \u201cAwesome thanks Mack\u201d
